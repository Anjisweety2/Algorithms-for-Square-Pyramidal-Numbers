# Algorithms-for-Square-Pyramidal-Numbers

This project contains two python files.  

Algorithm I.py checks whether every positive integer in some given range can be written as a sum of at most four square pyramidal numbers. 

Algorithm II.py checks whether every positive integer in some given range can be written as a sum of at most s square pyramidal numbers, for some positive integer s.

Both algorithms have similar goals. In fact, Algorithm II is more generally applied, as it allows the user to pick the number of square pyramidal numbers in the representation. However, Algorithm I is more efficient, and thus is necessary for checking large integers.
